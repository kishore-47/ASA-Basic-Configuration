🔗 Cisco Packet Tracer Network Topology

📘 Project Overview
This project represents a simulated network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed for understanding core networking concepts such as LAN segmentation, VLAN design, switch configuration, and firewall integration.

The network topology includes:

3 LAN segments (highlighted in different colors)

3 Cisco switches (2960-24TT)

Multiple PCs and servers

A Cisco ASA 5506-X firewall

🧩 Components Used
PC-PT (PC0–PC5) – End-user devices

Server-PT (Server0–Server4) – Server devices

2960-24TT Switch (Switch0, Switch1, Switch2) – For segmenting LANs

5506-X ASA Firewall (ASA0) – For network security and routing between segments

🧱 Network Segments
Left Segment (Pink): 4 PCs connected via Switch0

Top Segment (Purple): 2 PCs and 1 Server connected via Switch1

Right Segment (Green): 4 Servers connected via Switch2

All segments are connected to a central ASA firewall, acting as a gateway and firewall for inter-network communication.

🔧 Key Features
Layer 2 and Layer 3 segmentation

Inter-VLAN routing via firewall

Centralized server network

Multiple end-user and server nodes for realistic simulation

🚀 Getting Started
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Observe the physical layout and verify connectivity.

You can assign IPs, configure VLANs, ACLs, and test communications using the ping tool.

Optionally, configure ASA firewall rules for network security.

📚 Learning Objectives
Learn switch-based LAN setup

Understand firewall placement and purpose

Practice subnetting and inter-network routing

Explore server-client communication in segmented networks
