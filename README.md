🔐 Cisco ASA Firewall – Basic Configuration
A beginner-friendly setup to understand and configure Cisco ASA Firewall using Cisco Packet Tracer or real ASA hardware.

📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a basic ASA firewall configuration to:

✅ Allow internal LAN users to access the internet

❌ Block unauthorized inbound traffic

🔄 Set up NAT (Network Address Translation)

🔐 Apply security levels and ACLs

Zone Design:
Inside (LAN): security-level 100

Outside (Internet): security-level 0

🧠 Key ASA Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
# Configure outside interface
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 nameif outside
 security-level 0
 ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

# Configure inside interface
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 nameif inside
 security-level 100
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown

# Configure NAT
object network obj-inside
 subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface

# Allow inside to access outside
access-list OUTBOUND extended permit ip any any
access-group OUTBOUND in interface outside

# Default route
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.0.2.254
🧪 How to Test
Assign IPs to PCs (e.g., 192.168.1.10/24, Gateway: 192.168.1.1)

From the PC, ping 8.8.8.8 or access a simulated web server

Check NAT table:

bash
Copy
Edit
show xlate
Verify ACL:

bash
Copy
Edit
show access-list
